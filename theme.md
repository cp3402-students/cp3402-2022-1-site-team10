Features and design decisions: 
The Jazz Club theme is a simple theme, designed for customisation in WordPress. 
This theme is suitable for a jazz club and has room for further customisation for any website with a simple emphasis on an art deco style through subtle patterns and colour schemes. The header and footer images are hardcoded while everything else is interchangeable in WordPress customisation.
The decision to make the major portion customisable is due to the fact that art deco has a wide variety of colours and styles. It also leaves room for branching away from an entire art deco theme and provides subtle elements. For example, the current header background image is set with a gradient in a golden colour easily associated with art deco and then subtle patterning laid over the top

It includes room for social media integration to run a live feed on a chosen page of the theme and a customisable social media menu.
